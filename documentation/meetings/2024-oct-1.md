### Meeting Oct 1 2024

* 1. Create an automated process to update the gene annotations given a new version of Wormbase
    * Take the current Wormcat
        * Find any dead genes
        * Find any new genes
        * Find any changes

* 2. Create a process to move the updated genes to Wormcat production
    * Need to have a way of testing

----

* 3. Develop a computational tool for clustering genes based on Expression and phenotype
    * Expression Data
        * __When__ genes are expressed (time: Embryo, Larval, Adult)
            * This is modencode data
        * __Where__ genes are expressed (cell or tissue: Intestine, neuron,)
            * _Ahringer_ is a tissue specific dataset (https://www.dropbox.com/work/Ahringer_new)
                * With this data focus on the "Only" tabs in the spreadsheet
            * _Murphy_ is a tissue specific dataset
            * _Kenyon_ is a single cell dataset
            * _Orourke_ (Spelling??) is a single cell dataset
            * _Meag Wnag_ is a single cell dataset

        * __What__ is expression level (RNA counts)


* __TODO:__
    * Read: “Systems-level transcriptional regulation of Caenorhabditis elegans metabolism”  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36942755/
    * Plot overlap of Ahringer data ("Only" tabs) on Modencode data
        * https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jqwgzstfrevykapiwi7pe/Supplemental_Table_S2_used.xlsx?dl=0&rlkey=ire83n1z4qvj2lrnl04nni3ms
    * Create a standardized set of Phenotypes
        * Explore using BIO BERT
    * Create a test strategy for how our "standardized set of Phenotypes" maps back to RNAi screen that have been done
    * Are PAGs expressed at lower levels than other genes (This has already been done by Amy and Dan)


    
* Genes that are expressed together function together
* c. elegans Phenotypes do not have a standardized language
