Aim1: AI/ML approach for C. elegans IDGs for phenotype prediction, resource generation Many IDGs have C. elegans orthologs. Thus, the rich public information cataloging each C. elegans geneâ€™s expression during development, in tissues or in response to environmental factors, can be used to in machine learning protocols to cluster IDG kinases, GPCRs and Ion Channels with well described genes.  We will use WormCat to define highly enriched physiological categories in each cluster and provide linkages to phenotypes in WormBase .  This database will be incorporated into WormCat to spark discovery by other C. elegans labs.


Here's a plan for the proposed research project on using AI/ML for *C. elegans* Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) and phenotype prediction. 


### **Phase 1: Literature Review and Data Curation (3-4 months)**
- **Objective**: Identify and compile relevant data sources for *C. elegans* orthologs of IDGs, gene expression profiles, developmental stages, tissue specificity, and environmental response.
  - **Tasks**:
    1. Review available datasets on kinases, GPCRs, ion channels in *C. elegans*.
    2. Collect expression data and phenotypic annotations from WormBase and other sources.
    3. Identify relevant datasets from *C. elegans* labs, focusing on developmental, tissue, and environmental factors.
    4. Explore and gather information about WormCat for physiological categorization.
  - **Timeframe**: 3-4 months.

### **Phase 2: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering (2-3 months)**
- **Objective**: Clean and preprocess the data for machine learning. Generate meaningful features that capture gene expression, phenotypes, and tissue specificity.
  - **Tasks**:
    1. Clean the gene expression data (e.g., removing noise, normalizing).
    2. Create feature matrices for machine learning (e.g., expression during development, in different tissues).
    3. Incorporate phenotypic data from WormBase, linking to specific gene clusters.
    4. Use WormCat to categorize physiological functions.
  - **Timeframe**: 2-3 months.

### **Phase 3: Machine Learning Model Development and Clustering (3-5 months)**
- **Objective**: Develop machine learning protocols to cluster IDGs (kinases, GPCRs, ion channels) with well-annotated *C. elegans* genes.
  - **Tasks**:
    1. Select ML models (e.g., clustering algorithms such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, or deep learning approaches like autoencoders).
    2. Train models to identify clusters based on gene expression and physiological categories.
    3. Evaluate and optimize models to ensure accurate clustering.
    4. Validate clusters using known gene-phenotype relationships.
  - **Timeframe**: 3-5 months.

### **Phase 4: Integration with WormCat and WormBase (2-3 months)**
- **Objective**: Incorporate the clustering results into WormCat for easy access and discovery by the research community.
  - **Tasks**:
    1. Collaborate with WormCat developers to integrate the database.
    2. Develop tools to visualize the clusters and provide functional insights.
    3. Link clusters to phenotypes in WormBase for comprehensive analysis.
  - **Timeframe**: 2-3 months.

### **Phase 5: Validation and Resource Generation (2-3 months)**
- **Objective**: Validate the ML-generated clusters with wet-lab experiments or literature and create a robust resource for other *C. elegans* researchers.
  - **Tasks**:
    1. Collaborate with experimentalists to validate some predictions.
    2. Refine models based on feedback and validation results.
    3. Generate documentation and resources to aid other labs in using the database.
  - **Timeframe**: 2-3 months.

### **Phase 6: Dissemination and Publication (2-3 months)**
- **Objective**: Publish the results, share the database, and present findings to the research community.
  - **Tasks**:
    1. Write a manuscript detailing the research findings, methods, and resource.
    2. Prepare a presentation for conferences.
    3. Release the database to the public (via WormCat or a separate repository).
  - **Timeframe**: 2-3 months.

### **Total Estimated Timeframe**: 14-21 months

This plan provides a broad outline. Timeframes may adjust based on data availability, technical challenges, or collaboration pace.
